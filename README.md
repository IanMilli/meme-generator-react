# Overview

## Description

This web application is a Meme Generator that allows a user to search for images using the Pexel API, select from the returned options or upload their own image from their local computer to be converted into a meme. Text can be added over the image and styled as the user requires. The User can then download the image or copy to their clipboard.

## Features

The main features of this application are :

* Image search for preferred image

## Development


First we crafted the user story :

As a user I want to be able to generate a meme that i can add personal styling choices to using a application created with React Js

Then we wire framed the project to define the mvp as well as how we could later develop the application. To see the WireFraming image go to the following [Link](#wireframing).

We then set up the git hub repository and created the initial react application with react create app. After that we split the tasks equally between us looking at how we could create our intended product. At each stage we carried out research, trial, testing, re research if needed, testing of a basic form of our intended feature then advanced the feature to a higher level. For example, the first api we used generated a set limit of pictures for dog pictures. we used this to first define the use of Axios and to generate an image that we could then experiment adapting into a meme. This api was then discarded for a more complex one allowing users to search for images based on their own parameters. We approached each feature the same way with experimentation, research and testing to produce the level of product we were looking for .

## Wireframing

The first stage of our project after crafting our user story was to wire frame our project. The following is the wire frame for the mvp which has since evolved.



## Usage
To use the site a user can access the web application by going to the link for deployed application at [Links](#links)

We first met to discuss the idea for the project. We looked at several options and landed on a Meme Generator. We then created the GitHub repository to host our development and shared access. We used this repo to create a Kanban board / project. We then allocated / took tasks from the Kanban board and worked on our development. We did a stand up meeting most days and updated each other with progress and challenges. We used Slack in between those times to communicate with each other. We made sure we tackled MVP and avoided specification creep.

Once there they can search for a picture to form the backdrop of their Meme using our picture search feature or upload their own image from their computer. Once they have selected the image that they wish to work on they can add text to both the bottom and or the top of the picture using the input boxes in the meme generator section. They can style the text and then copy the image to their clipboard or download it to their computer.

## What We learned

* The importance of good collaboration and communication, how to work as a team and bounce ideas off each other to create our initial application idea. 

* The importance of research and product testing

* How to adapt code to work the way we require to enable the features that we want to produce

*Cool function to download the element which had the image and text overlayed as a png file

## ü§ù Continued development


### What We learned


To develop this project we could :


* Increase the number of styling parameters that a user could add to the project to adapt their meme.
* Add feature to allow user to directly share their meme into a social media application such as slack, discord, facebook,etc
* Add a warning so if a user gets no response from the API they will be informed.
* Connect a messaging app that allows a user to send images.
* Add more formats such as bmp, jpeg etc the user can choose from
* Carousel beneath the text so the user can audition the results of the image search automatically
* Storage of user generated memes online so users/others can link/use the memes
* Allow the user to make multiple searches and amalgamate the their chosen results
* Allow the user to create multiple meme files at once
We are open to all kinds of contributions. If you want to:

* ü§î Suggest a feature
* üêõ Report an issue
* üìñ Improve documentation
* üë®‚Äçüíª Contribute to the code
